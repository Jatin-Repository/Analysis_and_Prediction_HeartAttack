Under this Repository, I have tried to create a UI for my Machine Learning Project, "Predection and Analysis of Heart Attack".
Intially User will vist the page where he/she need to enter his/her own details along with the health up detail, recived from the LAB.
Later, on submission it shows the chances of person to suffer from heart attack or not.
